# angular-sketchpad

This project creates a sketchpad with [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [P5JS](https://p5js.org/).

To run it locally just run `npm run start`.

The P5JS sketch that I created was orignally copied [from here](https://editor.p5js.org/Janglee123/sketches/HJ2RnrQzN).

I found this [stackoverflow article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49472433/how-to-use-p5-js-in-angular-5-application/53464162) helpful when setting up P5JS with Angular.

If you wanted to move the sketch around on the page, I found [this page](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Positioning-your-canvas) on the Processing Wiki helpful.
